The point that impresses me the most in this text is that it debates upon what is virtual. It states that virtual exists in relation to the actual, and both virtual and actual are equally real. This to me is a brand new notion because I've always consider virtual as the opposite to actual, and that a virtual reality (VR) could be a fanciful reality that is completely irrelevant to the real world. However, applying the concept in this text, I figured that even if you create a whole new virtual world with avatars that live only in that world, what happens there is still real. The avatars could have emotions and actions that affect upon that reality, and they consider themselves to be real. Or, the humans joining in that virtual reality are actual participants even if their biological bodies aren't involved. If there exists awareness, there exists realness. This reminds me of the Netflix production West World. The hosts (synthesized creatures with extremely high intelligence and strong body) in the episodes fought themselves to a world that allow them to be free. Their minds could be copied (as they are just a few lines of code), and so some of them chose to live in a digital world backed up in the cloud. We, organic organisms, may never be able to construe creatures made from code and fibers. But it doesn't mean that being organic is the only means to be real. Until the age of the fully self-aware AI comes, we can still try to resolve and understand between ourselves of the same species. And then, the problems may be incomprehensible.
