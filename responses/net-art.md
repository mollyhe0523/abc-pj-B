My pick is K-HOLE’s Youth Mode. The Net Art Anthology concludes this report that "as the possibility of real uniqueness grew vanishingly small, blending in with the crowd would become a signifier of freedom.” K-HOLE suggests that the point of blend in is to be free, not to act and dress just as the mainstream generic taste. However, the media confused Normcore with “acting basic”, mislead the trend to be "chameleon-like”.

It is interesting to me that the artwork and the interpretation of it by the public and the press can be viewed separate here. What is intended in the report is to distinguish Normcore from acting basic, while the trend perceived and adopted otherwise. It is hard to tell whether it’s the press’s fault to have misread the message from K-HOLE and spread it wrong, or it’s the mainstream that intend to lead the trend to adopt a generic style. Maybe people’s needs and wants at that period of time is to dress normally and casually, and the report happened to appear at the right timing to be utilized to “quote and convince”.
